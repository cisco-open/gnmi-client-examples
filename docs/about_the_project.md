# About The Project

This repo provides a library that shows how to use a subscribe request through gRPC Network Management Interface (gNMI) in order to retrieve PBR counter statistics with Cisco XR models. This project will expand to other data in future releases. Support for C++ is currently provided. Potential for other language support in future releases.
